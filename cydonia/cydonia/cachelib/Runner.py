"""Runner manages a process spawned using subprocess.Popen and periodically measures attributes
    of the machine during the lifetime of the process. The following is the description of the 
    example files created per process and its contents:
    - /dev/shm/cydonia-runner/usage.csv - Periodic CPU and memory usage of the machine during process lifetime. 
    - /dev/shm/cydonia-runner/power.csv - Power consumption of each CPU and memory device during process lifetime. 
    - /dev/shm/cydonia-runner/stdout.dump - Dump of stdout. 
    - /dev/shm/cydonia-runner/stderr.dump - Dump of stderr. 

    Attributes:
        cpu_memory_measurement_window_sec: Time period between snapshot of CPU and memory usage. 
        terminate_event: Event that triggers termination of thread that track CPU and memory usage.
